The following is my Code Challenge for the Twitter BOTS team.
You will need ruby 2.1 or higher to run the game since I've used
required keyword arguments.
To start the game from a bash prompt just run from within lib: `ruby start_game.rb`
The game can start autonomously with a 10 x 10 grid with random live cells (default) or
with a predetermined world (2D array of 1s and 0s). Additionally an arbitrary
size for the world can be provided by starting the game like so:

game = Game.new(width: 2, height: 3)
game.start

All the starting methods for the game are covered in the start_game.rb file,
they just need to be commented and uncommented out to see them in action.
Tests can be found in the spec folder and they can be run form within the spec folder like so: `rspec game_spec.rb`

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Ri Caragol
